# midpoint-detailed-samples

This project contains detailed configuration samples for v4.4 and earlier versions of [midPoint](https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint).

You can contribute your own samples at [midPoint-samples](https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-samples). See the samples/contrib/README.md at that repo for more information. 


## Samples Source

These are detailed samples from institutions utilizing midPoint. Source credits are in the header of the file. 

## Warning

For post-initial-objects, first check if there is already an existing object in your midPoint! If there is, merge the changes in these examples into your specific version. Also some objects that always have defaults in midPoint are not complete in these examples such as system configurations and security policy objects! You must always merge these examples into your own midPoint system configuration and security policy.
