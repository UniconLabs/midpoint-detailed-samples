#Example of SCIM v1.1 enhanced

This is an example of connector to use SCIM to connect to Salesforce using a vanity url. There is also a Slack resource as well.

This does require an updated version of the connector which we hope will be merged into Evolveum's repo. For more info see [scim1.1_enhanced](https://github.com/UniconLabs/connector-scim1) 

This was funded and used by University of Wisconsin Madison and Dartmouth.
