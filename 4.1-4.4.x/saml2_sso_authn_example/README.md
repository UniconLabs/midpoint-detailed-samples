#Example of midPoint Flexible Authentication using a SAML2 SSO

This is an example of using midPoint's Flexible Authentication functionality to use a SAML2 SSO server to authenticate a user into midPoint.

Note: If using a container, it's usually best to ssh/exec/log into the container and grab the generated metadata via this 
  url: http://your_midPoint_server_url:8080/midpoint/auth/default/mysamlsso/metadata/spmidpoint using wget/curl or similar.
