#Example of writing CSV to Cloud Object Storage using Custom Connector

This is an example of connector to use Cloud Object Storage (specifically AWS S3) to export a CSV for use by other external applications. 
 
The existing CSV connector was enhanced to work with Cloud Object Storage providers. For more info see [cloud-object-storage-connector](https://github.com/UniconLabs/midPoint-cloud-csv-connector). 

This also has an example of a multi-valued attribute mapped into one column in the resource. 

This was funded and used by University of Wisconsin Madison.
